## An Empirical Study on Work, Identity, and Sentiment

**Live Research Survey:** [https://cyberhirsch.github.io/AI_survey/](https://cyberhirsch.github.io/AI_survey/)

## 1. Research Objective
This project is an empirical investigation into the **"Great Transition"** of human labor. We are moving from an era of manual execution to an era of machine orchestration. This project seeks to capture a real-time snapshot of how this transition is reshaping the human side of the economy—specifically focusing on the creative and engineering sectors.

## 2. Core Research Questions
Our inquiry is centered on three fundamental questions that will define the next decade of professional life:

### A. What constitutes "Professional Identity" in a curation-first world?
When a coder moves from writing syntax to "vibe coding," or an artist moves from drawing anatomy to "prompting," the definition of craftsmanship changes. 
- **The Inquiry**: Does the removal of "tedious toil" lead to higher professional satisfaction, or does it erode the sense of pride and self-worth that comes from manual mastery?

### B. At what point does assistance become Atrophy?
We are investigating the threshold where AI transitions from a productivity multiplier to a dependency.
- **The Inquiry**: To what extent are foundational skills (coding logic, compositional theory, manual drafting) being lost? Can a professional who relies 90% on AI still troubleshoot or innovate when the machine fails?

### C. How is sentiment correlated with capability?
There is a prevailing narrative of "AI Optimism" vs. "AI Fear." We want to map these emotional states against actual technical capability and AI adoption rates.
- **The Inquiry**: Are the most skilled professionals the ones who embrace AI most effectively, or is the "Cyborg" archetype a new class entirely that bypasses traditional skill-building?

### D. What is the perceived "Value" of AI-generated content?
As the internet is flooded with synthetic media, the human perception of "Value" is shifting.
- **The Inquiry**: Do people perceive AI content as a "commodity" (useful but soulless) or a new "frontier" of expression? How does the knowledge that a piece of content was AI-generated change its emotional or commercial value for the viewer?

## 3. Scientific Stakeholders & Value
Now that the data capture is live, we are providing granular insights for multiple scientific disciplines:

| Stakeholder | Research Interest |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Sociologists of Technology** | Shifting professional hierarchies and the birth of new "orchestrator" classes. |
| **Cognitive Psychologists** | The psychological impact of skill-atrophy and the "Terrified Cyborg" paradox. |
| **Labor Economists** | Measuring the widening productivity gap between traditionalists and AI-augmented workers. |
| **Philosophers (Ethics)** | The evolving concept of the "Human Soul" in labor and the ethics of machine-generated value. |

## 4. Expected Insights
Through this research, we expect to learn:
1. **The Archetypal Map**: Defining the standard personas of the transition (e.g., The Code Artisan, The Dreamweaver, The 10x Cyborg).
2. **The Reliance Index**: Quantifying exactly how many hours of project-time are being "outsourced" to machines vs. human thought.
3. **The Sentiment Matrix**: Understanding if the fear of replacement is tied to a lack of skill or a fundamental disagreement on the value of machine-generated work.

## 5. Dimensions of Measurement & Hypotheses
To quantify these abstract concepts, we track nine distinct metrics for every participant. By cross-referencing these, we can identify emerging patterns in the human-AI relationship.

### Core Metrics
- **Technical/Artistic Mastery (`tech`/`art`)**: Foundational competence in traditional craft. 
- **AI Orchestration (`vibe`)**: Proficiency in using AI to bypass manual execution (e.g., Vibe Coding).
- **Manual Resilience (`resilience`)**: Technical sovereignty; the ability to function without an internet connection or AI assistance.
- **Ethical Stance (`ethics`)**: Philosophical alignment with human-centric vs. machine-centric value systems.
- **Economic Anxiety (`anxiety`)**: Perceived threat level to personal livelihood over a 3-year horizon.
- **Content Sentiment (`content_value`)**: The emotional value assigned to AI-generated output (Soul vs. Commodity).
- **Strategic Sentiment (`sentiment`)**: General optimism vs. pessimism regarding the AI revolution.

### Hypothesized Patterns
Through this data, we aim to test several key hypotheses:

1. **The Fear-Knowledge Gap**: We hypothesize that high **Economic Anxiety** often correlates with low **Technical Mastery**. Is the fear of replacement actually a fear of obsolescence among those who never mastered their foundation? Or is it the **Veterans** (High Skill) who are most fearful because they recognize the risk of skill atrophy?
2. **The Amateur Adoption Paradox**: Are early adopters primarily **Amateurs** (Low Tech/Art, High Vibe)? We want to know if those who "don't know the risks" are rushing in to leverage AI as a shortcut, while experts remain cautious "Sentinels."
3. **The Sovereign Sentinel**: We seek to define the profile of the "Sovereign"—those who maintain high **Technical Mastery** and high **Manual Resilience** while selectively using AI. This group may represent the most stable professional path forward.
5. **The "Lindy Effect" in Skills**: We distinguish between **Transient Skills** (software-specific proficiency, syntax, prompt engineering) and **Lindy Skills** (logic, compositional theory, rhetoric, problem-solving). 
    - *Hypothesis*: Professionals who prioritize "Lindy Skills" will exhibit higher **Manual Resilience** and lower **Economic Anxiety**, as their value is decoupled from specific technological iterations.
6. **The Neurobiology of Curation**: Traditional "Syntax/Process Coding" provides frequent dopamine "micro-wins" (the code compiled! the brushstroke worked!). "Vibe/Orchestration" provides "macro-wins." 
    - *Hypothesis*: The shift from execution to curation may lead to a "Flow State Deficit," where the reduction in technical friction actually lowers the neurobiological reward of professional labor, leading to long-term burnout or lack of fulfillment.
7. **Holdout Control Group (The Luddite Bias)**: To ensure statistical validity, we must actively recruit "Lindy Holdouts"—professionals who intentionally reject AI tools.
    - *Metric*: This "Control Group" allows us to measure the baseline of human efficiency and satisfaction against the augmented group, mitigating the risk of only sampling "AI Enthusiasts."

## 6. Conclusion
This study aims to contribute to the ongoing dialogue regarding human sentiment during this period of technological change. By exploring these initial archetypes and dimensions, we hope to provide a useful data point for further research into how professionals navigate the evolving relationship between human skill and artificial intelligence.
